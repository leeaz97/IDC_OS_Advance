### (1) KVM: hypervisor, guest(s), and hypercalls

We using this [git](https://github.com/purplewall1206/kvm-hello-world). and update the code to answers the homework.

To run the hypervisor in _"long"_ mode,
make kvm-hello-world
./kvm-hellow-world -l

**(a) Study an example: "Hello, World!"**

- (a.1) What is the size of the guest (physical) memory? How and where in the code does the hypervisor allocate it? At what host (virtual) address is this memory mapped?

    - 0x200000 == 2097152 == pow(2,21) == 2 MB bytes of memory is allocated as the RAM for the guest. print in kvm-hello-world.c line 107. (in function `vm_init`)
    - in kvm-hello-world.c line 109, the hypervisor allocate the guest (physical) address:
    - `vm->mem = mmap(NULL, mem_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0);`
    - The host (virtual) address is this memory mapped print in kvm-hello-world.c line 113. (in function `vm_init`)

- (a.2) Besides the guest memory, what additional memory is allocated? What is stored in that memory? Where in the code is this memory allocated? At what host/guest? (virtual/physical?) address is it located?
    
    -  The additional allocated memory is vCPU. vCPU is the abbreviation for virtual centralized processing unit. vCPU represents a portion or share of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a particular VM.
    - memory allocated in the host as a virtual address:
    - `vcpu->kvm_run = mmap(NULL, vcpu_mmap_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, vcpu->fd, 0);` in kvm-hello-world.c line 154 (in function `vcpu_init`)
    - Print the virtual address in kvm-hello-world.c line 157. (in function `vcpu_init`)

The hypervisor then formats the guest memory and registers, to prepare for its
execution. (From here on, assume _"long"_ mode).

- (a.3) The guest memory area is setup to contain the guest code, the guest page table, and a stack. For each of these, identify where in the code it is setup, and the address range it occupies (both guest-physical and host-virtual).

    - The guest memory area is setup `memreg.guest_phys_addr = 0`. in kvm-hello-world.c line 123
    - Kernel stack is setup `regs.rsp = 2 << 20`; in kvm-hello-world.c line 535 
    - Print the range (both guest-physical and host-virtual) in kvm-hello-world.c line 493-497 (in function `setup_long_mode`).

- (a.4) Examine the guest page table. How many levels does it have? How many pages does it occupy? Describe the guest virtual-to-physical mappings: what part(s) of the guest virtual address space is mapped, and to where?

    - 4 Levels:
    - 1. Page Map Level 4 (PML4) - 8 KB == 8192 byte position
    - 2. Page Directory Pointer Table (PDPT) - 12 KB == 12288 byte position
    - 3. Page Directory Table (PDT) - 16 KB == 16384 byte position
    - 4. Page Table (PT)
    - the physical page is found


For both (a.3) and (a.4), illustrate/visualize the hypervisor memory layout
and the guest page table structure and address translation. (Preferably in
text form).

- (a.5) At what (guest virtual) address does the guest start execution? Where is this address configured?

    - The guest virtual address start execution in `memreg.guest_phys_addr = 0` (in kvm-hello-world.c line 123 (in function `vm_init`))
    - this config `regs.rip = 0` in in kvm-hello-world.c line 532 in function `run_long_mode`.

- (a.6) What port number does the guest use? How can the hypervisor know the port number, and read the value written? Which memory buffer is used for this value? How many exits occur during this print?

    - The port number is `0xE9 = 233`.
    - When the hypervisor run the recognizr the direction is output by the port (that define also in the guest) and then print the value.
    - The memory buffer `p + vcpu->kvm_run->io.data_offset`.
    - 14 exits occur during "Hello, world!\n". 15 is printed beacuse we call print() to print the occur 14+1. 

- (a.7) At what guest virtual (and physical?) address is the number 42 written? And how (and where) does the hypervisor read it?

    - Number 42 written in the guest physical address vm->mem + 0x400 and the physical is 0x400 (in kvm-hello-world.c line 301)

**(b) Extend with new hypercalls**

In the code that found in directory Part A+B+C.
To run the hypervisor in _"long"_ mode,
make kvm-hello-world
./kvm-hellow-world -l

**(c) Filesystem para-virtualization**

In the code that found in directory Part A+B+C.
To run the hypervisor in _"long"_ mode,
make kvm-hello-world
./kvm-hellow-world -l

**(d) Bonus: hypercall in KVM**

Not implemant.

**(e) Multiple vCPUs**

Extend the program _kvm-hello-world.c_ to launch a guest with 2 vCPUs, with
an instance of the guest running on each vCPU independently and concurrently, 
including invoking hypercalls. You will need to use another process/thread to
run the second vCPU. For this setup, double the size of the guest physical
memory and allow each guest instance (vCPU) to use half, to protect them from
each other. You will need to provide a distinct guest page table for each of
the guest instances (in the _"long"_ mode).

(e.1) Add code or pseudo-code, to _kvm-hello-world_ and to _guest.c_ that
implements the necessary changes described above.

(e.2) Bonus: complete your code such that it compiles and works, and test it
to demonstrate that it operates correctly.

The bonus question is optional.

### (2) Containers and namespaces

In this assignment you will implement a simples container runtime that can
spawn a command in an isolated environment.

For this assignment, you need to understand the basics of Linux namespaces;
Read through __"Digging into Linux namespaces"__:
[part 1](https://blog.quarkslab.com/digging-into-linux-namespaces-part-1.html)
and 
[part 2](https://blog.quarkslab.com/digging-into-linux-namespaces-part-2.html).

We will use the following steps to build a fully isolated environment for a
given process:

1. Create user namespace; remap the UIDs/GIDs in the new _userns_
2. Create uts namespaces; change hostname in the new _utsns_
3. Create ipc namespace
4. Create net namespace; create and configure veth interface pair
5. Create pid namespace
6. Create mnt namespace; mount /proc inside the new _mntns_

(Note that the process would run in an isolated environment, but would share
the same root filesystem as the parent, just in a separate _mntns_).

These steps can be done in userspace as follows:

            Parent shell                     Child shell
            -------------------------------  -----------------------------

          3                                  $ unshare -U --kill-child /bin/bash
          4                                  $ echo "my-user-ns" > /proc/$$/comm

(a) Describe the process hierarchy produced by the sequence of commands in the
"child shell" column. How can it be minimized, and what would the hierarchy
look like?

(b) What would happen if you change the order of namespace creation, e.g. run
`unshare --ipc` first? And what would happen if you defer lines 12-13 until
a later time?

(c) What is the purpose of line 4 and lines 9-10 (and similarly, line 27 and
lines 29-30)? Why are they needed?

(d) Describe how to undo and cleanup the commands above. (Note: there is more
than one way; try to find the minimal way). Make sure there are no resources
left dangling around.

(d) Write a program that would implement the sequence above, whose usage is:

        usage: isolate PROGRAM [ARGS...]

For example, the command:

        isolate ps aux

would execute the command "ps aux" inside an isolated environment.

For this, you may use the skeleton below that uses _clone(2)_ to create new
namespaces:

        #define STACK_SIZE (1024*1024)
        char stack_child[STACK_SIZE];

        int create_namespaces()
        {
            int fds[2];
            int flags;
            pid_t pid;

            pipe(fds);
            
            // recieve signal on child process termination
            flags = SIGCHLD | \
                    CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNET | CLONE_NEWUTS | \
                    CLONE_NEWIPC| CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWPID;

            // the child stack growns downwards 
            pid = clone(child_func, stack_child + STACK_SIZE, flags, fds);
            if (pid == -1) {
                fprintf(stderr,"clone: %s", strerror(errno));
                exit(1);
            }
            
            setup_userns(pid);
            setup_netns(pid);

            write(c->fd[1], &pid, sizeof(int));
            close(c->fd[1]);
            waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
        }

        void int child_func(void *args)
        {
            int fds[2] = args;
            pid_t pid;

            read(fds[0], &pid, sizeof(int));
            close(fds[0]);

            setup_mntns();
            setup_utsns();

            write(c->fd[1], &pid, sizeof(int));
            close(c->fd[1]);
            waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
        }

        void int child_func(void *args)
        {
            int fds[2] = args;
            pid_t pid;

            read(fds[0], &pid, sizeof(int));
            close(fds[0]);

            execvp(...);
        }

Note: you may (and should) use the _system()_ helper to implement the
_setup\_mntns()_ and _setup\_netns()_ functions; but not for the
_setup\_utsns()_ and _setup\_userns()_.

(e) Test your program. Does it require root privileges? If so, then why?
How can it be changed to not require these privileges?
